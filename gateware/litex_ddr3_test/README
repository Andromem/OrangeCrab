# OrangeCrab DDR3 test code

``` Currently under-development ``` 

## Build Instructins
```console
$ python3 OrangeCrab-bitstream.py [ddr3_test|base|bist] 
 ```

This will invoke Litex/Migen to compile bios and generate bitstream for the ECP5.
When the synthesis is complet you will be left with "build/gateware/top.svf"

## Loading
Run this command to invoke openOCD and load the bitstream onto the FPGA via a JTAG adapter
 ```console
$ python3 load_fpga.py 
 ```




## Running DDR3 Tests

The Litex DDR3 test code is run by connecting a serial link to the OrangeCrab on External Pins 0/1


In a new terminal run the litex_server
```console
$ litex_server --uart --uart-port [PORT] --uart-baudrate 115200
```

In your original terminal
```console
$ python3 test_identifier.py
```

This will connect to the board and return the Bitstream ID String


```console
$ python3 test_sdram.py
```
Connects to the wishbone bus in the FPGA and performs memory operations in the address space mapped to the DDR3 memory.
