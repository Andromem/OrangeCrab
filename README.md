## ECP5 DDR3 memory in a Feather form-factor.

	Project status: Still in Development (Use stuff here if you want, but there is limited support. It may simply not work)

## What is it
This project started with a one goal: "Make a simple ECP5 + DDR3L breakout". At some point I decided it would be neat to make it match the adafruit feather format. 


## Hardware
* Lattice ECP5 25/45/85 variants
* 1x DDR3L Memory upto 8Gbit (x16)
* Micro USB connection
* Full-speed (12Mbit) USB direct connection to FPGA
* Battery charger, with charge indicator LED
* Reset Button 
* 16Mbit QSPI FLASH Memory (Bitstream + User storage)
* 4bit MicroSD socket
* 48MHz Oscillator (Used by USB system)
* ATSAMD10/11 Co-processor planned mainly for the ADC/DAC
* All spare I/O's broken out onto a 30pin low profile connector
  * 7 diff pairs
  * 1 single ended only
