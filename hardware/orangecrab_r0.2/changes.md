# Hardware changes planned from r0.1 to r0.2

* Swap FLASH to larger footprint, to support larger variants
* Rework power traces throughout board.
    * All DDR3 Power pins, use larger traces
    * Use larger traces when possible on the ECP5
* Investigate using reset pin to reset + hard reset (Maybe with GreenPak)
