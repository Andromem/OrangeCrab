Impedances

	Control to within 10%.

	Layer 3 microstrip (ref to layer 2 Ground / 4 Power)
		121 μm trace = 50 ohm single ended
		105 μm trace / 150 μm space = 100 ohm differential

	Layer 6 microstrip (ref to layer 5 Ground)
		121 μm trace = 50 ohm single ended
		105 μm trace / 150 μm space = 100 ohm differential
